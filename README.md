# angular-signature-generator
Angular JS powered e-mail signature generator for internal staff members 

# Description
- Simple webapp to help internal staff members generate an HTML based e-mail signature. Built in 10 minutes using Angular. (Massively overkill, I know).
- All assets packaged into a single HTML file so it can be attached to an e-mail and executed locally.
